The `cdumay_error_derive` crate provides procedural macros to simplify the creation of custom error types in Rust. By leveraging these macros,
developers can efficiently define error structures that integrate seamlessly with the `cdumay_error` error management ecosystem.

## Overview

Error handling in Rust often involves creating complex structs to represent various error kinds and implementing traits to provide context and
conversions. The `cdumay_error_derive` crate automates this process by offering macros that generate the necessary boilerplate code, allowing for
more readable and maintainable error definitions.

## Features

* **Macros**: Automatically generate implementations for custom error types.
* **Integration with cdumay_error**: Designed to work cohesively with the `cdumay_error` crate, ensuring consistent error handling patterns.

## Usage

See [cdumay_error](https://docs.rs/cdumay_error) documentation for more information.
